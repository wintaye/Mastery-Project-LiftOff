## LiftOff

### Overview
We would like to create an app that would allow users to both learn and teach their skills with other users. If they have a skill they're knowledgeable in, they can opt to teach it to other users. If they have a skill that they're interested in learning, they can interact with other users to set up a meeting to learn the skill the other user knows. The users will be able to share both their availability and location, so they can set up a time and place to meet up and share their skills and knowledge with one another.
